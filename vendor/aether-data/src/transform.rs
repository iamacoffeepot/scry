//! ADR-0048 §1 native-transform runtime types + link-time inventory.
//!
//! A transform is a **data-layer primitive** — a pure `Kind -> Kind`
//! function with zero dependence on the actor framework (no `Ctx`, no
//! mail, no lifecycle). Its surface therefore lives here, next to
//! `Kind` and the native descriptor inventory, not in the actor SDK.
//! The authoring macro `#[transform]` re-exports from `aether-data` as
//! `aether_data::transform` (impl in the sibling `aether-data-derive`
//! crate, which `aether-data` cannot itself be — a proc-macro crate
//! can't export runtime items).
//!
//! There is no FFI shim, no `extern "C"`, no wasm custom section — the
//! original wasm-export design was deferred before implementation
//! (ADR-0048 revision 2026-05-20). A transform is plain native Rust
//! collected at link time through [`TransformEntry`].
