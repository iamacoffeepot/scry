//! Leaf-body encode and decode.
//!
//! This module is the only place in the storage tree that names the
//! ADR-0188 owned codec ([`crate::wire::WireEncode`] / [`crate::wire::WireDecode`]).
//! The TLV layer contributes the field-hash-and-length envelope; leaf
//! bodies are the same bytes the positional wire already uses for that
//! type. Binding to a later name for those traits is an edit to this
//! file and nothing else.
